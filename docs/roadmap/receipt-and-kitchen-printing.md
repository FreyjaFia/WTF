## Receipt & Kitchen Printing Feature [Planned]

Bluetooth/USB thermal printer integration for customer receipts and
kitchen order tickets.

**NOTE: Requires physical printer hardware for testing.** Development can
start with print preview UI and a mock print service. Actual hardware
integration happens when a printer is available.

### Printer Connection

- Evaluate Capacitor ESC/POS printer plugins (e.g.,
  `capacitor-thermal-printer`, `@nicecode/escpos`)
- Support connection types: **Bluetooth** (most common for mobile POS),
  **USB**, and **Network/IP** (for kitchen printers)
- `PrinterService` (`core/services/`):
  - `discoverPrinters()` - scan for nearby Bluetooth/network printers
  - `connect(printerId)` / `disconnect()`
  - `printReceipt(order)` - format and send receipt data
  - `printKitchenTicket(order)` - format and send kitchen ticket
  - `testPrint()` - send a test page to verify connection
  - Maintain connection state as signals (`isConnected`,
    `connectedPrinter`)

### Receipt Printing

Triggered after a completed order or manually via the order detail page.

**Receipt layout (58mm or 80mm thermal paper):**

Auto-printed when an order is created or when items are added to an
existing order. Sent to a separate kitchen printer.

 2:30 PM - Cashier: Alain
=============================
 1x Iced Latte (L)
    + Vanilla Syrup
 1x Croissant
-----------------------------

=============================
```

- Only includes items and special instructions (no prices)
- Bold/large font for order number for visibility
- When items are **modified** on an existing order, reprint with
  "MODIFIED" header and highlight changes

### Printer Settings UI

New route: `/management/settings/printers` (or a section within a
general settings page).

- List discovered printers with connect/disconnect buttons
- Assign printer roles: **Receipt Printer** and **Kitchen Printer**
  (can be the same or different devices)
- Toggle: auto-print receipt on order completion (on/off)
- Toggle: auto-print kitchen ticket on order creation (on/off)
- Test print button for each connected printer
- Save printer preferences in `localStorage` (device-specific)

### Print Preview

- Before sending to a physical printer, show an on-screen preview
  modal with the formatted receipt/ticket
- Useful for development without a printer and for user confirmation
- "Print" and "Cancel" buttons on the preview

### Reprint

- On the order detail page, add "Print Receipt" and "Print Kitchen
  Ticket" buttons
- Works for any past order, not just the current one
